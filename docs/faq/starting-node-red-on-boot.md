title: Starting Node-RED on boot
slug: start on boot
---

There are many methods of starting, stopping and monitoring applications at boot
time. This guide highlights some of the possible ways of doing it.

### Raspberry Pi, Debian, Ubuntu

The [Raspberry Pi install script](/docs/getting-started/raspberrypi) we provide
can be used on any Debian-like operating system.

This script installs Node-RED as a [systemd](https://wiki.debian.org/systemd) service.
For more information, read the [Running on Raspberry Pi](/docs/getting-started/raspberrypi#autostart-on-boot)
guide.

If you are not using Raspberry Pi OS, you may need to edit the service file to suit
your local user id and environment. Details for how to do that are available
[here](/docs/faq/customising-systemd-on-pi).

### RPM based Linux, RedHat, Fedora, CentOS

We also provide an install script for RPM based linux [available here](https://github.com/node-red/linux-installers), that also sets up systemd.

### Other Linux, OSX

The guide below sets out what we believe to be the most straight-forward for
the majority of users. For Windows, PM2 does not autorun as a service -
you may prefer the [NSSM option](#alternative-options) below.

#### Using PM2

[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) is a process manager for Node.js. It makes
it easy to run applications on boot and ensure they are restarted if necessary.

#### 1. Install PM2

    sudo npm install -g pm2

<div class="doc-callout">
<em>Note</em> : <code>sudo</code> is required if running as a non-root user on Linux or OS X. If
running on Windows, you will need to run in a <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/cc947813%28v=ws.10%29.aspx">command shell as Administrator</a>,
without the <code>sudo</code> command.
</div>

<div class="doc-callout">
If running on Windows, you should also ensure <code>tail.exe</code> is on your path, as
described <a href="https://github.com/Unitech/PM2/blob/development/ADVANCED_README.md#windows">here</a>.
</div>

#### 2. Determine the exact location of the `node-red` command.

If you have done a global install of node-red, then on Linux/OS X the `node-red`
command will probably be either: `/usr/bin/node-red` or `/usr/local/bin/node-red`.
The command `which node-red` can be used to confirm the location.

If you have done a local install, it will be `node_modules/node-red/bin/node-red`,
relative to where you ran `npm install` from.

#### 3. Tell PM2 to run Node-RED

The following command tells PM2 to run Node-RED, assuming `/usr/bin/node-red` as
the location of the `node-red` command.

The `--` argument must appear before any arguments you want to pass to node-red.

    pm2 start /usr/bin/node-red -- -v

<div class="doc-callout">
<em>Note</em> : if you are running on a device like the Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone
Black that have a constrained amount of memory, you must pass an additional argument:

<pre>pm2 start /usr/bin/node-red --node-args="--max-old-space-size=128" -- -v</pre>
</div>

<div class="doc-callout">
<em>Note</em> : if you want to run as the root user, you must use the `--userDir`
option to specify where Node-RED should store your data.
</div>

This will start Node-RED in the background. You can view information about the
process and access the log output using the commands:

    pm2 info node-red
    pm2 logs node-red

More information about managing processes under PM2 is available [here](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2#process-management).

#### 4. Tell PM2 to run on boot

PM2 is able to generate and configure a startup script suitable for the platform
it is being run on.

Run these commands and follow the instructions it provides:

    pm2 save
    pm2 startup

for newer Linux systems that use **systemd** use

    pm2 startup systemd

<div class="doc-callout">
<em>Temporary Note:</em> There's an <a href="https://github.com/Unitech/PM2/issues/1321">
open issue</a> on PM2 on GitHub which highlights an issue that has been introduced recently.
Linux users need to manually edit the generated `/etc/init.d/pm2-init.sh` file and replace

<pre>export PM2_HOME="/root/.pm2"</pre>

to point at the correct directory, which would be like:

<pre>export PM2_HOME="/home/{youruser}/.pm2"</pre>
</div>

#### 5. Reboot

Finally, reboot and check everything starts as expected.

### Windows

PM2 does not autorun as a service on Windows. An alternative option is to use NSSM,
an example of which is available from the community link below.


### Alternative options

There are many alternative approaches. The following are some of those created
