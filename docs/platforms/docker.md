title: Running under Docker

There are many ways you could choose to run Node-RED under Docker. This guide
describe some of the ways you can do it.

It assumes you have some basic familiarity with Docker and the
[Docker Command Line](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).


### Container versions

We publish three tagged versions of the container to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nodered/node-red-docker/):

- `latest` - uses [official Node.JS v4 base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/).
- `slim` - uses [Alpine Linux base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mhart/alpine-node/).
- `rpi` - uses [RPi-compatible base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/hypriot/rpi-node/).

Using Alpine Linux reduces the built image size (~100MB vs ~700MB) but removes
standard dependencies that are required for native module compilation. If you
want to add modules with native dependencies, use the standard image or extend
the slim image with the missing packages.

Additional images using a newer Node.js v8 base image are now available with the following tags.

- **v8** 
- **slim-v8**
- **rpi-v8**

Node-RED releases are also tagged with a version label, allowing you to fix on a specific version: `latest:X.Y.Z`, 
`slim:X.Y.Z`, `rpi:X.Y.Z`.

### Quick start

To run the `latest` container:

    docker run -it -p 1880:1880 --name mynodered nodered/node-red-docker

*Note:* on a Raspberry Pi you must use a `rpi`-tagged image: `nodered/node-red-docker:rpi`.

This command will download the `nodered/node-red-docker` container from DockerHub
and run an instance of it with the name of `mynodered` and with port 1880 exposed.
In the terminal window you will see Node-RED start. Once started you can then
browse to `http://{host-ip}:1880` to access the editor.

Hit `Ctrl-p` `Ctrl-q` to detach from the container. This leaves it running in the
background.

To reattach to the container:

    docker attach mynodered

To stop the container:

    docker stop mynodered

To start the container:

    docker start mynodered


<div class="doc-callout">
<p><em>Note</em> : your flows will be stored in the file called <code>flows.json</code>
within the container. This can be customised by setting the <code>FLOWS</code>
environment parameter:
</p>
<pre>docker run -it -p 1880:1880 -e FLOWS=my_flows.json nodered/node-red-docker</pre>
<p>Node.js runtime arguments can be passed to the container using an environment parameter (<code>NODE_OPTIONS</code>). For example, to fix the heap size used by the Node.js garbage collector you would use the following command:
</p>
<pre>docker run -it -p 1880:1880 -e NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=128" nodered/node-red-docker</pre>
</div>


### Customising

The container uses the directory `/data` as the user configuration directory. To
add additional nodes you can open shell into the container and run the appropriate
`npm install` commands:

    # Open a shell in the container
    docker exec -it mynodered /bin/bash

    # Once inside the container, npm install the nodes in /data
    cd /data
    npm install node-red-node-smooth
    exit

    # Restart the container to load the new nodes
    docker stop mynodered
    docker start mynodered

### Storing data outside of the container

It is possible to mount the `/data` path on an external volume:

    docker run -it -p 1880:1880 -v ~/node-red-data:/data --name mynodered nodered/node-red-docker

This command mounts the host's `~/node-red-data` directory as the user configuration directory inside the container.

Adding extra nodes to the container can then be accomplished by running `npm install`
on the host machine:

    cd ~/node-red-data
    npm install node-red-node-smooth
    docker stop mynodered
    docker start mynodered

<div class="doc-callout">
<p><em>Note</em> : Modules with a native dependencies will be compiled on the host
machine's architecture. These modules will not work inside the Node-RED
container unless the architecture matches the container's base image. For native
modules, it is recommended to install using a local shell or update the
package.json and re-build.</p></div>


### Building the container from source

The Dockerfiles for these containers are maintained [here](https://github.com/node-red/node-red-docker), each under its own branch.

To build your own version:

    git clone https://github.com/node-red/node-red-docker.git
    cd node-red-docker

    # Build it with the desired tag
    docker build -f <version>/Dockerfile -t mynodered:<tag> .


### Building a custom image

Creating a new Docker image, using the public Node-RED images as the base image,
allows you to install extra nodes during the build process.

1. Create a file called `Dockerfile` with the content:

        FROM nodered/node-red-docker
        RUN npm install node-red-node-wordpos

2. Run the following command to build the image:

        docker build -t mynodered:<tag> .

That will create a Node-RED image that includes the `wordpos` nodes.

### Updating

Updating the base container image is as simple as

    docker pull nodered/node-red-docker
    docker stop mynodered
    docker start mynodered

### Linking Containers

You can link containers "internally" within the Docker runtime by using the
`--link` option.

For example, if you have a container that provides an MQTT broker container called `mybroker`, you can run the Node-RED container with the `link` parameter to join the
two:

    docker run -it -p 1880:1880 --name mynodered --link mybroker:broker nodered/node-red-docker

This will make `broker` a known hostname within the Node-RED container that can be
used to access the service within a flow, without having to expose it outside
of the Docker host.
