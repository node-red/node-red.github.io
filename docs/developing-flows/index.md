*This guide is for developers who understand the basic fuctinality and want to develop more clear and reusable flows. If you think that you are beginner, please read **[User Guide](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/)** and **[Cookbook](https://cookbook.nodered.org/)** first.*  

*In Node-RED, users can create flows easily and in ad hoc manner. However, if you want to create more reusable and readable flows, some tips, practices and know how may be needed. Therefore, flow development guideline page is intended for gathering such knowledge. We believe this page is useful for most Node-RED users.*  

*Before adding guideline to the Node-RED official page through a pull request, we would like to discuss contents and where to place it with somebody who are interested in this guideline. This wiki page is for discussing them.*  

*At first, we’d like to show a contents list and where to place it on Node-RED official page. After that, we will write the actual contents and discuss it with Node-RED community because we would reduce unnecessary work.*
