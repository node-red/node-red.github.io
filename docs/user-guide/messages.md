A Node-RED flow works by passing messages between nodes. The messages are simple
JavaScript objects that can have any set of properties.

Messages usually have a `payload` property - this is the default property that
most nodes will work with.

Node-RED also adds a property called `_msgid` - this is an identifier for
the message which can be used to trace its progress through a flow.

~~~~~json
{
    "_msgid": "12345",
    "payload": "..."
}
~~~~~

The value of a property can be any valid JavaScript type, such as:

 - Boolean - `true`, `false`
 - Number - eg `0`, `123.4`
 - String - `"hello"`
 - Array - `[1,2,3,4]`
 - Object - `{ "a": 1, "b": 2}`
 - Null

### Understanding the structure of a message

The easiest way to understand the structure of a message is to pass it to a Debug
node and view it in the Debug sidebar.

By default, the Debug node will display the `msg.payload` property, but can be
configured to display any property or the whole message.

When displaying an Array or Object, the sidebar provides a structured view that
can be used to explore the message.

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;" src="/docs/user-guide/images/messages_debug.png" width="388px">

 - At the top it shows the name of the property that has been passed in. Here,
   the default `msg.payload` has been used.
 - Next to the property name is the type of the property - `Object`, `String`, `Array`
   etc.
 - It then shows the contents of the property. For Arrays and Objects, the property
   is collapsed into a single line. By clicking on it, the property will expand
   to show more detail.

<br style="clear: both;" />

When you hover over any element, a set of buttons appear on the right:

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;" src="/docs/user-guide/images/messages_debug_detail.png" width="388px">

- <i style="border-radius: 2px; display:inline-block;text-align:center; width: 30px; color: #777; border: 1px solid #777; padding: 6px;" class="fa fa-terminal"></i> : copies the
  path to the selected element to your clipboard. In this example, it will copy
  `payload.Phone[2].type`. This allows you to quickly determine how to access a
  property in a Change or Function node.

- <i style="border-radius: 2px; display:inline-block;text-align:center; width: 30px; color: #777; border: 1px solid #777; padding: 6px;"  class="fa fa-clipboard"></i> : copies the
  value of the element to your clipboard as a JSON string. Note that the sidebar
  truncates Arrays and Buffers over a certain length. Copying the value of such
  a property will copy the truncated version.

- <i style="border-radius: 2px; display:inline-block;text-align:center; width: 30px; color: #777; border: 1px solid #777; padding: 6px;"  class="fa fa-map-pin"></i> : pins the
  selected element so it is always displayed. When another message is received
  from the same Debug node, it is automatically expanded to show all pinned elements.


#### Working with JSON

JSON, ([JavaScript Object Notation](http://json.org)), is a standard way for
representing a JavaScript object as a String. It is commonly used by web APIs to
return data.

If a message property contains a JSON string it must first be parsed to its
equivalent JavaScript object before the properties it contains can be accessed.
To determine whether a property contains a String or Object, the Debug node can
be used.

Node-RED provides a `JSON` node to do this conversion.

### Changing message properties

A common task in a flow is to modify the properties of a message as it passes
between nodes. For example, the result of an `HTTP Request` may be an object with
many properties, of which only some are needed.

There are two main nodes for modifying a message, the Function node and the Change
node.

The Function node allows you to run any JavaScript code against the message. This
gives you complete flexibility in what you do with the message, but does require
familiarity with JavaScript and is unnecessary for many simple cases. More
information about writing Functions is available [here](../writing-functions).

The Change node provides a lot of functionality without needing to write JavaScript
code. Not only can it modify message properties, but it can also access flow- and
global-context.

It provides four basic operations:

 - `Set` a property to a value,
 - `Change` a String property by performing a search and replace,
 - `Delete` a property,
 - `Move` a property.


 <img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;" src="/docs/user-guide/images/messages_change.png" width="420px">

For the `set` operation, you first identify what property you want to set, then
the value you want it to have. That value can either be a hardcoded value, such
as a string or number, or it can be taking from another message or flow/global
context property. It also supports using the [JSONata](http://jsonata.org) expression
language to calculate a new value.

For example, using the Debug node's ability to determine a message element's path,
you can paste the path straight into the 'to' field, with `msg.` selected from the
list. That will then set `msg.payload` to the value of `msg.payload.Phone[2].type`.

<br style="clear: both;" />

Another example, using a [JSONata](http://jsonata.org) expression, is to convert a
temperature, held in `msg.payload.temperature`, from Fahrenheit to Celsius and
store the result in a new message property `msg.payload.temperature_c`.

<img src="/docs/user-guide/images/messages_expr.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 20px;" width="420px">

`````json
{
    "payload": {
        "temperature": 90,
        "temperature_c": 32.22222
    }
}
`````
{:style="display: inline-block;"}
<br style="clear: both;" />
*Note that JSONata expressions look a lot like JavaScript, but have some key differences.
Refer to the [jsonata.org](http://jsonata.org) site for more inforation.*

### Message sequences

A message sequence is an ordered series of messages that are related in some way.
For example, the Split node can turn a single message whose `payload` is an Array,
into a message sequence where each message has a `payload` corresponding to one
of the array elements.

#### Understanding `msg.parts`

Each message in a sequence has a property called `msg.parts`. This is an object
that contains information how the message fits in the sequence. It has the following
properties:

<dl>
<dt><code>msg.parts.id</code></dt><dd>a unique identifier for the sequence</dd>
<dt><code>msg.parts.index</code></dt><dd>the message's position within the sequence</dd>
<dt><code>msg.parts.count</code></dt><dd>if known, the total number of messages in the sequence</dd>
</dl>

*Note:* the parts array may contain additional meta-data about the sequence. For example,
the `split` node also attaches information that can be used by the `join` node to
reassemble the sequence. See the `split` node's documentation.

#### Working with sequences

There are a number of core nodes that can work across message sequences:

##### Split

Turns a single message into a sequence of messages.

The exact behaviour of the node depends on the type of `msg.payload`:

<dl>
<dt>String/Buffer</dt><dd>the message is split using the specified character
(default: `\n`), buffer sequence or into fixed lengths.</dd>
<dt>Array</dt><dd>the message is split into either individual array elements, or
arrays of a fixed-length.</dd>
<dt>Object</dt><dd>a message is sent for each key/value pair of the object.</dd>
</dl>

##### Join

Turns a sequence of messages into a single message.

The node provides three modes of operation:
<dl>
<dt>Automatic</dt><dd>attempts to reverse the action of a previous <code>Split</code> node</dd>
<dt>Manual</dt><dd>allows finer control on how the sequence should be joined</dd>
<dt>Reduce</dt><dd><i>New in 0.18</i> - allows a JSONata expression to be run against each message in the sequence and the
result accumulated to produce a single message.</dd>
</dl>

##### Sort

*New in 0.18*

Sorts the sequence based on a property value or JSONata expression result.

##### Batch

*New in 0.18*

Creates new sequences of messages from those received.

The node provides three modes of operation:
<dl>
<dt>Number of messages</dt><dd>groups messages into sequences of a given length.
The overlap option specifies how many messages at the end of one sequence should
be repeated at the start of the next sequence.</dd>
<dt>Time interval</dt><dd>groups messages that arrive within the specified interval.
If no messages arrive within the interval, the node can optionally send on an
empty message.</dd>
<dt>Concatenate Sequences</dt><dd>creates a message sequence by concatenating
incoming sequences. Each sequence must have a <code>msg.topic</code> property to
identify it. The node is configured with a list of topic values to identify
the order sequences are concatenated.</dd>
</dl>
