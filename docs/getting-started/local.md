### Prerequisites

To install Node-RED locally you will need a [supported version of Node.js](/docs/faq/node-versions).

### Installing with npm

To install Node-RED you can use the `npm` command that comes with node.js:

```
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
```

If you are using Windows, do not start the command with <code>sudo</code>.

That command will install Node-RED as a global module along with its dependencies.

You can confirm it has succeeded if the end of the command output looks similar to:

```
+ node-red@1.1.0
added 332 packages from 341 contributors in 18.494s
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

### Installing with docker

To run in Docker in its simplest form just run:
```
docker run -it -p 1880:1880 --name mynodered nodered/node-red
```
For more detailed information see our [docker](/docs/getting-started/docker) guide.

### Installing with snap

If your OS supports [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install) you can install
Node-RED with:

```
sudo snap install node-red
```

When installed as a Snap package, it will run in a secure container that **does not have access** to some extra facilities that may be needed for you to use, such as:

 - access to main system storage. Can only read/write to local home directories.
 - `gcc` - needed to compile any binary components of nodes you want to install
 - `git` - needed if you want to use the Projects feature
 - direct access to gpio hardware
 - access to any external commands your flows want to use with the Exec node (for example).

If you need access to system hardware or to add nodes that require compilation then we recommend using a full install of Node-RED and not using the snap.

### Running

Once installed as a global module you can use the `node-red` command to start
Node-RED in your terminal. You can use `Ctrl-C` or close the terminal window
to stop Node-RED.

```
$ node-red

Welcome to Node-RED
===================

30 Jun 23:43:39 - [info] Node-RED version: v1.3.5
30 Jun 23:43:39 - [info] Node.js  version: v14.7.2
30 Jun 23:43:39 - [info] Darwin 19.6.0 x64 LE
30 Jun 23:43:39 - [info] Loading palette nodes
30 Jun 23:43:44 - [warn] rpi-gpio : Raspberry Pi specific node set inactive
30 Jun 23:43:44 - [info] Settings file  : /Users/nol/.node-red/settings.js
30 Jun 23:43:44 - [info] HTTP Static    : /Users/nol/node-red/web
30 Jun 23:43:44 - [info] Context store  : 'default' [module=localfilesystem]
30 Jun 23:43:44 - [info] User directory : /Users/nol/.node-red
30 Jun 23:43:44 - [warn] Projects disabled : set editorTheme.projects.enabled=true to enable
30 Jun 23:43:44 - [info] Creating new flows file : flows_noltop.json

30 Jun 23:43:44 - [info] Server now running at http://127.0.0.1:1880/red/
```

You can then access the Node-RED editor by pointing your browser at <http://localhost:1880>.

The log output provides you various pieces of information:

 - The versions of Node-RED and Node.js
 - Any errors hit when it tried to load the palette nodes
 - The location of your Settings file and User Directory
 - The name of the flows file it is using.

Node-RED uses `flows_<hostname>.json` as the default flows file. You can change
this by providing the flow file name as argument to the `node-red` [command](/docs/getting-started/local#command-line-usage).

### Command-line Usage

Node-RED can be started using the command `node-red`. This command can take
various arguments:

```
node-red [-v] [-?] [--settings settings.js] [--userDir DIR]
         [--port PORT] [--title TITLE] [--safe] [flows.json|projectName]
         [-D X=Y|@file]
```

Option                  | Description     |
------------------------|-----------------|
`-p`, `--port PORT`     | Sets the TCP port the runtime listens on. Default: `1880` |
`--safe`                | Starts Node-RED without starting the flows. This allows you to open the flows in the editor and make changes without the flows running. When you deploy your changes, the flows are then started. |
`-s`, `--settings FILE` | Sets the settings file to use. Default: `settings.js` in `userDir` |
`--title TITLE`         | Set process window title |
`-u`, `--userDir DIR`   | Sets the user directory to use. Default: `~/.node-red` |
`-v`                    | Enables verbose output |
`-D X=Y|@file`          | [Override individual settings](#override-individual-settings) |
`-?`, `--help`          | Shows command-line usage help and exits |
`flows.json|projectName`| If the Projects feature is not enabled, this sets the flow file you want to work with. If the Projects feature is enabled, this identifies which project should be started. |

Node-RED uses `flows_<hostname>.json` as the default flows file. If the computer
you are running on may change its hostname, then you should ensure you provide a
static file name; either as a command-line argument or using the `flowsFile` option
in your [settings file](/docs/user-guide/runtime/settings-file).

#### Override individual settings

*Since Node-RED 1.1.0*

You can override individual settings on the command-line using the `-D` (or `--define`)
option.

For example, to change the logging level you can use:
```
-D logging.console.level=trace
```

You can also provide the custom settings as a file:
```
-D @./custom-settings.txt
```

The file should contain a list of the settings to override:
```
logging.console.level=trace
logging.console.audit=true
```




### Passing arguments to the underlying Node.js process

There are occasions when it is necessary to pass arguments to the underlying
Node.js process. For example, when running on devices like the Raspberry Pi or
BeagleBone Black that have a constrained amount of memory.

To do this, you must use the `node-red-pi` start script in place of `node-red`.
_Note_: this script is not available on Windows.

Alternatively, if are running Node-RED using the `node` command, you must provide
arguments for the node process before specifying `red.js` and the arguments you
want passed to Node-RED itself.

The following two commands show these two approaches:

    node-red-pi --max-old-space-size=128 --userDir /home/user/node-red-data/
    node --max-old-space-size=128 red.js --userDir /home/user/node-red-data/

### Upgrading Node-RED

<img src="/images/logos/debian.svg" height="30">
<img src="/images/logos/ubuntu.svg" height="30">
</div>
If you installed Node-RED using the Pi script, you can rerun it to upgrade. The
script is available <a href="/docs/hardware/raspberrypi">here</a>.</div>

If you have installed Node-RED as a global npm package, you can upgrade to the
latest version with the following command:

```
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
```

If you are using Windows, do not start the command with <code>sudo</code>.
