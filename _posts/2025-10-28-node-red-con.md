Node-RED Con 2025 is just a week away! This year's online conference will showcase how Node-RED is driving innovation across industries — from factory floors and utilities to finance and smart homes.

We've put together a full schedule of talks from across the community and it's promising to be a great event.

I'll be giving the opening keynote on the current state of the project and where we're headed. This includes unveiling the results of our recent community survey and what plans we have for modernizing the Node-RED user experience.

I'm really looking forward to the event and I hope you'll join the 1000+ people who have already registered to attend.

Be sure not to miss out and get registered [here](https://events.zoom.us/ev/AqhqiQ8mTK2lnAoOEH8c8TA1a_9MzVhZq_T7d1-kMHlHDt2_Qh_0~ArONnIcxMjLKoD3Stc16u8yBa38mn0RO4y2nOMx4AZqewgJ1dZm6TAmYyyVgBk3jzn2T5FyGxH2VdIpi_Oe6V7CxaA)!
