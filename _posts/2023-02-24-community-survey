description: It is time to re-launch our Node-RED community survey
---

Back in 2019 we published the results of the 2019 Node-RED community survey. The results 
painted an interesting picture of the Node-RED community. We think it is time to refresh
these results so we are running the survey again.

The 2023 survey is similar to the 2019, we wanted to get a better picture of who our uses are, what they do with Node-RED
and to make sure we keep the project pointed in the right direction.

The survey will be open until March 31. Of course we would like to get as many respondents
as possible. In 2019, we have over 800 individuals respond so hopefully we can meet this number
again this year. 

Once the survey has been completed, we will publish the results for the entire community to see.

The survey should take less than 10 minutes to complete. Thank you in advance for your feedback.
